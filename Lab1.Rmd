## Question 1

### 1 
It is not possible to represent exact 1/3 and 1/12 in binary. As a result it is rounded towards nearest computer float and in R its equal to 0.33333333333333331 and 0.083333333333333329 respectively.

### 2

Instead of writing  ``if(x1 - x2 == 1/12)`` it should be written ``if(isTRUE(all.equal(x1-x2,1/12)))``. In this case this equation will return TRUE.
